hi Pete are you okay hi Diana can I talk to you about something sure what's the problem it's about Maria you know we've been together for 2 months now and you know I well I'm deeply in love with her yes well I did something bad last night maybe for a little too long a really long time actually Maria wasn't very happy not a good idea okay some advice please you should speak to her Pete if you say nothing it'll make things worse than they are already I know talking about it is more difficult than you think though well why don't you send her an email tell her you're sorry and that you promise you won't do it again she won't read an email from me at the moment I'm sure of that well then I think you should leave the office early she takes the early bus so you'll see her at the bus station then you can speak to her tell her that you love her she'll definitely change her mind girls love that kind of talk you don't know Maria if I tell her I love her too soon she'll get frightened and leave me okay then make a reservation at a nice restaurant persuade her to go out for dinner with you if you do that I'm sure everything will be all right oh I guess you're right I'll leave work early and try to find her at the bus station good and Pete's yeah okay Diana
